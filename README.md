# Store Inventory Manager

## Project Description

In order to run a successful store, it is key to keep track of the current stock and profits. This allows a business
owner to make important decisions on the future of their venture. A simple program to keep tack of inventory and profits
can help keep this data organized.

This program has applications for any small business owner in order to keep organized with their stock and to not
oversell. 

The features in this program will include:
- Adding new items with a name and price
- Replenish items stock
- Sell items 
- Check revenue
- Check stock of an item

This project is of interest to me since I am involved in small businesses that currently use messy Excel sheets and feel
limited with what they can do with them. Making a program to help simplify these basic tasks would remove the learning
curve of Excel and allow business owners to focus purely on their business.
