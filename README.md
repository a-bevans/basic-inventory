# Store Inventory Manager

## Project Description

In order to run a successful store, it is key to 
keep track of the current stock and profits. This allows
a business owner to make important decisions on the future
of their venture. A simple program to keep tack of inventory,
customers, and profits can be of great benefit
to keep this data organized.

This program has applications for any small business
owner in order to keep organized with their stock
and to not oversell. The tab feature could also be used 
by a bar or other business that can operate on IOUs.

The features in this program will include:
- Adding new items with a cost and price
- Replenish items stock
- Sell items to a Customer
- Keep a tab for a Customer
- Pay a Customer's tab
- Check profits
- Check stock of an item

This project is of interest to me since I am involved
in small businesses that currently use messy Excel sheets
and feel limited with what they can do with them. Making
a program to help simplify these basic tasks would remove
the learning curve of Excel and allow business owners to
focus purely on their business.
